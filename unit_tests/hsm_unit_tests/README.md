Unit tests for HSM

To build:

- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org)
- Make a directory, preferably with the prefix 'build' (e.g. build_msvc)
- Change into the new build directory (```cd build_msvc```)
- Run ```cmake ..```
- Now you can build the generated make file/workspace/solution depending on your target platform.
